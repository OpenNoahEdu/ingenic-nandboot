This is the source code of the NAND Secondary Program Loader (SPL).
The NAND SPL itself will be first loaded by the IPL (Initial Program Loader)
inside the CPU, then it loads the kernel image from NAND into RAM and 
starts the kernel from RAM.

To build the NAND SPL, follow next steps:

  $ cd src/
  $ make

And you will get a binary file called n-boot.bin.

Before building the SPL, you should open config.h and check the 
configuration is correct for your system.

For JZ4730, the n-boot.bin must be less than 4KB.

For JZ4740, the n-boot.bin must be less than 8KB.

The platform definitions were declared in include/jz47xx_board.h.
Please check and modify it according to your system.
